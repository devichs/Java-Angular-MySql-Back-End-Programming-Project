## BACK-END PROGRAMMING PROJECT
This was a project to work on and develop object-oriented applications that can be integrated with relational databases, write code for object-oriented applications using Spring framework, and implement design patterns for object-oriented applications. 

## PROJECT SETUP
For this project, I used IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition) in a Windows Server 2019 environment. I worked with a MySQL database and Angular front-end, which were supplied.
